# Description

Multiple issues have been identified regarding the authentication and authorization of certain endpoints in the Keycloak software.

## Unauthenticated access to certain functionalities

It has been observed that certain functionalities within Keycloak, specifically the */metrics* and */health* endpoints, are accessible without proper authentication. Even though these endpoints do not provide sensitive information, it is preferable that they are accessible only to authenticated individuals with the correct privileges.

## Unauthorized use of administrative features by low-privilege users

Additionally, users with low privileges are able to utilize administrative functionalities within the Keycloak admin interface. This issue presents a significant security risk as it allows unauthorized users to perform actions reserved for administrators, potentially leading to data breaches or system compromise. Affected endpoints are:

- /admin/realms/myrealm/client-registration-policy/providers
- /admin/myrealm/console/whoami
- /admin/realms/myrealm/testLDAPConnection

In particular, the last functionality (*testLDAPConnection*), in the event that an AD authentication system has been configured, allows to modify application data, **enabling the submission of an LDAP request and consequently the access credentials to a malicious endpoint**.

An attacker with access to a non-administrative user can modify the *connectionUrl* parameter, and the password will be sent to an attacker-controller server. To successfully execute the attack, it's also necessary to know the *componentId* related to the domain authentication, which is retrievable in the cookies K*EYCLOAK_SESSION*, *KEYCLOAK_SESSION_LEGACY*, and in the responses returned by the */admin/myrealm/console/whoami* endpoints.

Example of modified request:

``` http
